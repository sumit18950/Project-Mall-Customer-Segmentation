# Project-Mall-Customer-Segmentation
The primary objective of this project is to analyze customer data from a retail store and segment  customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior. By identifying these segments,  the retail store can tailor its marketing strategies to better meet the needs of each customer group,  ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction.
